            I work with self-made designs and collaborating with designers to
            build interactive, accessible and user friendly products. From
            working with small scale local businesses to international scale
            products like Schooltry, Schooltry Tertiary, GoHealth for the Gombe
            State government and the National Digital Registry for Nigeria, I've
            worked on, debugged, created and designed features and products used
            by thousands in their daily lives and professional lives.
